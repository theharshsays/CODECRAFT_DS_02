# CODECRAFT_DS_02
Internship Project on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Exploring the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

This project involved a thorough exploration of the Titanic dataset, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. Initial data cleaning addressed missing values in the 'Age', 'Cabin', 'Embarked', and 'Fare' columns using appropriate imputation techniques (median for numerical, 'Unknown' for categorical). EDA revealed several key factors influencing survival rates: passenger class, sex, age, fare, and family size. Higher passenger classes and female passengers exhibited significantly higher survival probabilities. Feature engineering created new variables such as 'FamilySize', 'IsAlone' and 'Title', potentially enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models.

The insights gleaned from this analysis can be leveraged to build effective predictive models for survival on the Titanic. Future work should focus on encoding categorical features, handling outliers, and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to achieve optimal performance in predicting passenger survival."

Explanation of the conclusion:

Feature engineering created new variables such as 'FamilySize', 'IsAlone' and 'Title', potentially enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models. A preliminary logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set.

A key challenge encountered was the handling of the 'Cabin' feature due to its high proportion of missing values and complex structure. Further analysis is available in [link to analysis notebook].

The insights gleaned from this analysis can be leveraged to build effective predictive models for survival on the Titanic, using tools like Python, Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit-learn. Future work should focus on encoding categorical features, handling outliers, experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, and exploring more sophisticated techniques for extracting information from the 'Cabin' feature to achieve optimal performance in predicting passenger survival.
